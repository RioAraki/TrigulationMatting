# TrigulationMatting
Deal with the triangulation matting technique using python/ numpy/ opencv

The file matting.py deal with all logics and algorithms. It takes five import pictures with the same size and output one alpha imgae, one color image and a composite image which matting the background to foreground object. This is already an boosted version and could deal with 1920*1280 pixels picture in less than one second. All details could be found in the paper included in repository.

The report.pdf records my analysis on this technique.
